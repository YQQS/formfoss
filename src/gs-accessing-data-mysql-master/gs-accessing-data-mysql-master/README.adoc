This guide walks you through the process of creating a Spring application connected with a MySQL Database, as opposed to an in-memory, embedded database, which all of the other guides and many sample apps use. It uses Spring Data JPA to access the database, but this is only one of many possible choices (e.g. you could use plain Spring JDBC).

== What you'll build

You'll create a MySQL database, build a Spring application and connect it with the newly created database.

NOTE: MySQL is licensed with the GPL, so any program binary that you distribute using it must use the GPL too. Refer to the http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html[GNU General Public Licence].

== What you'll need

* https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/[MySQL] version 5.6 or better. If you have docker installed it might be useful to run the database as a https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/[container].

== Create the database

Go to the terminal (command Prompt `cmd` in Microsoft Windows). Open MySQL client with a user that can create new users.

For example: On a Linux, use the command

[source, sh]
----
$ sudo mysql --password
----

NOTE: This connects to MySQL as a root, this is *not the recommended way* for a production server.

Create a new database

[source, mysql]
----
mysql> create database db_example; -- Create the new database
mysql> create user 'springuser'@'localhost' identified by 'ThePassword'; -- Creates the user
mysql> grant all on db_example.* to 'springuser'@'localhost'; -- Gives all the privileges to the new user on the newly created database
----

== Create the `application.properties` file

Spring Boot gives you defaults on all things, the default in database is `H2`, so when you want to change this and use any other database you must define the connection attributes in the `application.properties` file.

In the sources folder, you create a resource file `src/main/resources/application.properties`

[source, java]
----
include::complete/src/main/resources/application.properties[]
----

Here, `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` can be `none`, `update`, `create`, `create-drop`, refer to the Hibernate documentation for details.

* `none` This is the default for `MySQL`, no change to the database structure.
* `update` Hibernate changes the database according to the given Entity structures.
* `create` Creates the database every time, but don't drop it when close.
* `create-drop` Creates the database then drops it when the `SessionFactory` closes.

We here begin with `create` because we don't have the database structure yet. After the first run, we could switch it to `update` or `none` according to program requirements. Use `update` when you want to make some change to the database structure.

The default for `H2` and other embedded databases is `create-drop`, but for others like `MySQL` is `none`

It is good security practice that after your database is in production state, you make this `none` and revoke all privileges from the MySQL user connected to the Spring application, then give him only SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE.

This is coming in details in the end of this guide.

== Create the `@Entity` model

`src/main/java/hello/User.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/User.java[]
----

This is the entity class which Hibernate will automatically translate into a table.

== Create the repository

`src/main/java/hello/UserRepository.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/UserRepository.java[]
----

This is the repository interface, this will be automatically implemented by Spring in a bean with the same name with changing case
The bean name will be `userRepository`

== Create a new controller for your Spring application

`src/main/java/hello/MainController.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/MainController.java[]
----

NOTE: The above example does not specify `GET` vs. `PUT`, `POST`, and so forth, because `@RequestMapping` maps all HTTP operations by default. Use `@RequestMapping(method=GET)` to narrow this mapping.


== Make the application executable

Although it is possible to package this service as a traditional link:/understanding/WAR[WAR] file for deployment to an external application server, the simpler approach demonstrated below creates a standalone application. You package everything in a single, executable JAR file, driven by a good old Java `main()` method. Along the way, you use Spring's support for embedding the link:/understanding/Tomcat[Tomcat] servlet container as the HTTP runtime, instead of deploying to an external instance.


`src/main/java/hello/Application.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Application.java[]
----

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/build_an_executable_jar_subhead.adoc[]

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/build_an_executable_jar_with_both.adoc[]


Logging output is displayed. The service should be up and running within a few seconds.


== Test the application

Now that the application is running, you can test it.

Use `curl` for example.
Now you have 2 REST Web Services you can test

`localhost:8080/demo/all` This gets all data
`localhost:8080/demo/add` This adds one user to the data

[source,sh]
----
$ curl 'localhost:8080/demo/add?name=First&email=someemail@someemailprovider.com'
----

The reply should be

[source,sh]
----
Saved
----

[source,sh]
----
$ curl 'localhost:8080/demo/all'
----

The reply should be

[source,json]
----
[{"id":1,"name":"First","email":"someemail@someemailprovider.com"}]
----

== Make some security changes

Now when you are on production environment, you may be exposed to SQL injection attacks. A hacker may inject `DROP TABLE` or any other destructive SQL commands. So as a security practice, make those changes to your database before you expose the application to users.

[source,sh]
----
mysql> revoke all on db_example.* from 'springuser'@'localhost';
----

This revokes ALL the priviliges from the user associated with the Spring application. Now the Spring application *cannot do* anything in the database. We don't want that, so

[source,sh]
----
mysql> grant select, insert, delete, update on db_example.* to 'springuser'@'localhost';
----

This gives your Spring application only the privileges necessary to make changes to *only* the data of the database and not the structure (schema).

Now make this change to your `src/main/resources/application.properties`

[source,java]
----
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none
----

This is instead of `create` which was on the first run for Hibernate to create the tables from your entities.

When you want to make changes on the database, regrant the permissions, change the `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` to `update`, then re-run your applications, then repeat. Or, better, use a dedicated migration tool such as Flyway or Liquibase.

== Summary

Congratulations! You've just developed a Spring application which is bound to a MySQL database, Ready for production!
